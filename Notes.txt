====== Whaat is React =======
React is a front-end framework, it helps build front-end based applications with some more ease and some more features  on top of Js.
The Idea of React and other most front-end frameworks is to break your code to different components, and then combine them to form the application.
This makes working on large applications much easier.

====== How to think with React ======

1. Think of the application as a final product, what do you want the final product to look like.
2. Break that final product into different pieces.
3. Turn these pieces into components.
4. Let's imagine a list of ingredients (components) for a sandwich (the final product), imperative programming will be if we tell how to
   arrange these ingredients (components) to make the sandwich (the final product), declarative programming, which is the case in React,
   we don't tell how to arrange these ingredients, u got the ingredients, make me the product!!
